        <p><h2>Reaching Shegaon:</h2>  It is well connected to all places. Check out the official website of The Gajanan Maharaj Sansthan, Shegaon for detailed information.

<h2>Transportation:</h2> Transportation from railway station to the temple complex or Bhakta Nivas is no hassle at all, there is a free bus service available provided by the Temple Trust. These buses also take you to Anandsagar or Anand Vihar. Even auto-rickshaw services are available for reasonable rates.

<h2>Stay:</h2> I would recommend one to stay near the temple complex as there are lots of small to big hotels around it. One can also try the Sansthan’s guesthouses known as Bhakta Nivas which are very clean but can be difficult to get the bookings during the busiest months. Always better to pre-book them. One can also opt to stay in Anandsagar.

<h2> Food:</h2> I suggest one should have the Maha-Prasad i.e. the food offered at the temple complex as well as at Anandsagar resort. The Bhakta Nivas also offers lunch and dinner facilities. There are also restaurants or hotels which provide good quality food. Believe me, one will not fall short for opportunities here. One another must-have food item is the famous ‘Kachori’ of Shegaon. You must try it, it’s the tastiest kachori I have ever had!</p>

<h2>Travel Itinerary for Shegaon</h2>
<h3>Day 1 in Shegaon</h3>
Reach in the morning or the night earlier.
Visit the Shri Sant Gajanan Maharaj Temple.
Explore around the complex.
Visit to the Temple of Shri Sant Gajanan Maharaj and spend some time in the beautiful complex. One can check out the small souvenir shops as well as get all kinds of puja or takeaway prasad items from the shops inside the temple complex.

Once done with the darshan or visit, there are lots of shops and small cafes, ice-cream shops outside the temple complex to explore. There is an old movie theater too, where I remember watching a Rajnikanth movie the last time since we had some time to kill.

       <h3> Day 2 in Shegaon</h3>
Spend a day at the Anandsagar resort.
On your second day in Shegaon, visit the famous Anandsagar to enjoy its beautiful and serene atmosphere. It has all the food (from breakfast to lunch/ dinner), play, resting as well as meditating facilities. Believe me its grand but yet a very humble experience. One must-to-do thing here is to attend the live fountain show which happens once the sun goes down.

I have a whole another detailed post coming up for Anandsagar.

<h3>Day 3 in shegaon</h3>

Spend a day at the Nagzari.
Catch an evening/ night train back home.
On your Third day in Shegaon, visit the famous Mandir og Shri gomaji Maharaj. There is water pond outside the mandir enjoy in it.it is a famous and old mandir near shegaon.
